        </ol>
    </ol>
    <h2>Simple goiter</h2>
    <p>Simple goiters are common in females becasue there are estrogen receptors in the thyroid gland and it grows in responce to physiological estrogen secretion. Physilogical goiter occurs in puberty and pregnancy. No treatment is needed for physiological goiter. It resolves spontaniously when the metabolic demand is reduced (ie, after the teminatin of pregnancy).</p>
    <p>Pathological goiter occurs due to dietary iodine deficiency, dyshormonogenesis, and consumption of goitrogens (eg- cabbage, lithium, heavy water, excessive iodine)</p>
    <p>Multinidualr goiters are classified depending on the nature of the nodules as colloid, cystic, cellular, hemorrhagic and calcific nodules</p>
    <p>In long standing simple diffuse goiter, some areas of the gland can be more active than the others. These more active areas undergo hyperplasis. due to the inadequacy of blood supply to the hyperplastic areas, they undergo necrosis. Necrosis leaves behind cystic areas. This is multinodular goiter.</p>
    <p><strong>Investigations-</strong></p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><strong>TSH, T3, T4-</strong>To assess the thyroid status. Patient should be euthyroid to diagnose as simple goiter</li>
        <li><strong>Cheast X-ray-</strong>look for retrosternal extention, tracheal compression, tracheal deviation</li>
        <li><strong>Antithyroid antibodies-</strong>Exclude autoimmune thyroiditis</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Complications-</strong></p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Tracheal compression</li>
        <li>Progress to malignancy</li>
        <li>Tracheal deviation</li>
        <li>Retrosternal expansion</li>
        <li>Secondary hyperparathyroidism</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Prevention- </strong>iodized salt prevents endamic goiter</p>
    <p><strong>Treatment-</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Simple diffuse goiter- </strong>Thyroxine 150-200 micrograms daily for few months and observe for regression.</li>
        <li><strong>Multinodular goiter- </strong>Is irreversible. Asymptomatic MNG is not an indication for surgery. Indications for surgery in MNG are cosmetic reasons, pressure symptoms, retrosternal extension tracheal compression, suspicion of malignancy, secondary thyrotoxicosis.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Discrete thyroid swelling</h2>
    <p>An isolated nodule / solitery nodule is when only one discrete nodule is present in a otherwise normal thyroid gland. The prominent / largest nodule in a gland with may nodules is named a dominant nodule.</p>
    <p><b>Investigations-</b></p>
    <p><b>TSH, T3, T4- </b>To assess the thyroid status. If a patient has hyperthyroidism with a solitary thyroid nodule, the clinical diagnosis is toxic adenoma. If the patient has hyperthyroidism with a multinodular goiter, the clinical diagnois is toxic multinodular goiter</p>
    <p><b>USS of neck- </b>Now one of the firs line investigations. Can look for subclinical nodularity, cysts, and features of malignancy like microcalcifications, increased vascularity, and lymph node involvement. The dominant nodule of a multinodular goiter is most likely to be a cystic lesion.</p>
    <p><b>FNAC- </b>Usually done following USS. Aspirate from any suspicious  nodules can be lookded for cytological features of malignancy. No use of FNAC of dominent nodule of MNG as it is very likely to be a cystic aspirate. FNAC can make definitive diagnosis of colloid nodule, thyroiditis, papillary carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma and lymphoma. Histology of thyroid is essential to differentiate follicular adenoma from follicular carcinoma</p>

    <p><b>Radioisotope scan-</b>Not routinely done because of the improved resolution of USS. May be done in toxic MNG to look for the presence of hot nodules</p>
    <table>
        <caption>Nodules in isotope scan</caption>
        <tr><td>Hot nodule</td><td>Nodule is overactive compared to rest of the gland- more radioiodine uptake compared to background</td></tr>

        <tr><td>Cold nodule</td><td>Nodule is less active compared to rest of the gland- less radioiodine uptake compared to background</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p><b>Chest X ray, both AP and lateral- </b>To exclude retrosternal extension, tracheal compression, deviation.</p>
    <p>CT, MRI, PET scans are not usually done. But may be done in large retrosernal extensions, previous surgery, and recurrence of malignancy</p>
    <P><b>Vocal cord assessment- </b>Done for medicolegal requirements. Patient is assessed by an ENT surgon and findings documented before the surgery</P>
    <p><b>Indications for surgery</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Confirmed neoplasia - FNAC reports Thy 5, Cervical lymph metastasis</li>
        <li> Suspicious of neoplasia - FNAC reports Thy3, Thy 4, Male, hard fixed thyroid, rapid enlargement, recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, old age</li>

        <tr><td>Sumtotal thyroidectomy</td><td>2 x subtotal lobectomy + isthmusectomy</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Near-total thyroidectomy</td><td>total lobectomy + isthmusectomy + subtotal lobectomy (Dunhill procedure)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Lobectomy</td><td>total lobectomy + isthmusectomy</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>Total thyroidectomy is done more frequently because it has many advantages- Immediate return to euthyroid status, no risk of disease recurrence, no repeat surgery (completion thyroidectomy) is difficult than the first, and all suspicious nodules are removed at once. Only diadvantage in total thyroidectomy is the need for lifelong thyroid hormone treatment</p>
</div>
<p><b>Retrosternal goiter- </b>Even large retosternal goiters can be asymptomatic. Some can be severly symptomatic. Symptoms are stridor, dysphagia, dyspnea, engorged neck and face veins, vocal cord paralysis.<span style="background-color: #df78ef;"> Never attempt antithyroid drugs or radioiodine in retrosernal goiter.</span> It may enlarge. Small retrosternal goiters can be deliverd whole form the usual neck incision. Very large ones require midline sternotomy. Piecemeal removal from the neck has the risk of leaving behind fragments which may continue to grow if malignant.</p>

<!-- Second section Examinatin-->
<div class="content">
    <h1><a name="section2">Examination</a></h1>

    <!--TODO insert the notes for the examination section-->
    <p>Start examination from the front. Ask the patient to look straight ahead and swallow. If the lump moves on swallowing, it is goiter.
    </p>
    <p>Inspect the lump from front. Look for symmetry, visible nodules, scars fo previous surgery, engorged neck and face veins, stridor, and skin changes</p>
    <p>Palpation is started from front. Palpate to see if the lump that you saw moving when swollowing is present. Look for tracheal deviation. Are there any tender nodules.  Proper palpation is done from behind. Both hands behind the neck, neck slightly flexed to relax anterior neck muscles. One hand stabilized and other hand palpates. Make sure the lump is in the thyroid by asking the patient to swallow when a lump if found. is the lower border palpable? is there lymphadenopathy? is there a palpable thrill? </p>
    <p>Purcussion is not done usually. Can be rarely useful in retrosternal goiter.</p>
    <p>Auscultation is done for bruits. Ask the patient to turn the head to right and hold breath. Auscultate on the upper lateral pole of the left lobe. Vice versa for right lobe.</p>
    <p>After confirming that it is a goiter and the anatomica abnormalitis, check the thyroid status.</p>
    <p><b>Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism- </b>Fine tremor, sweaty palms, restless, exophthalmos, lid lag, lid retraction, ophthalmoplegia, chemosis, tachycardia, irregular pulse (elderly patients with secondary AF), collapsing pulse, heaving apex, ejection systolic murmur, Increased appetite, loss of weight, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, palpitations, dyspnea, diarrhea, oligomenorrhoea, insomnia, anxiety.</p>
    <p><b>Signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism- </b>Dry cold skin, facial puffiness, loss of outer part of eye brow, pretibial myxedema, bradycardia, slow movements, slow relaxing ankle jerk, lethargy, somnolence, constipation, arthralgia, loss of appetite, weight gain, cold intolerance, numbness of hands, hoarseness of voice, deafness.</p>
    <p>Eyes should be examined to determine exopthalmos and lid retraction.</p>

        <li><b>Plummer disease- </b>Another name for toxic multinodular goiter. Toxic multinodular goiter is a multinodular goiter associated with hyperthyroidism. It is a common cause of hyperthyroidism in which there is excess production of thyroid hormones from functionally autonomous thyroid nodules, which do not require stimulation from thyroid stimulating hormone. Toxic multinodular goiter is the second most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the developed world.</li>
