    <!--TODO insert the notes for the theory section-->
  <p>Small lumps and bumps are common short cases. The objctive is to do a methodical examination and present the findings in a rational manner. This is a general discussion on the examination of miscellaneous lumps. What componet to examine depends on where the lump is. Use a bit of common sense without mechanically following all the steps. Do not listen for a bruit in what looks like a hydrocele or look for reducibility in what looks like a fibroademoma!</p>
  <p>Components of the examinaton may be done in any order. Make sure that you have a clear idea about the lump before presenting the findings.</p>
  <p>Start by introducing yourself, getting the consent, and adequately exposing the lump. Ask about pain before starting palpation.</p>
  <p>The order of examinatin and order of presentation is not necesserily the same. Examine the lump to find the following<ul>
  <li>Site</li>
  <li>Size</li>
  <li>Shape</li>
  <li>Surface</li>
  <li>Contour</li>
<li>Consistancey</li>
  <li>Pulsatility</li>
  <li>Reducibility</li>
  <li>Fluctuation</li>
  <li>Mobility</li>
  <li>Tenderness</li>
  <li>Temperature</li>
  <li>Transillumination</li>
  <li>Percussion</li>
  <li>Auscultation</li>
    </ul>
When presenting, follow the SPACESPIT sequence.
<ul>
<li><b>S</b>ize</li>
<li><b>P</b>osition</li>
<li><b>A</b>ttachments</li>
<li><b>C</b>onsistancey</li>
<li><b>E</b>dges</li>
<li><b>S</b>urface and shape</li>
<li><b>P</b>ulsation, thrills and bruits</li>
<li><b>I</b>nflammation</li>
<li><b>T</b>ransillumination</li>
</ul> </p>
<p>The regional lymph nodes should be examined for enlargement</p>

<!-- Second section Examinatin-->
<div class="content">
    <h1><a name="section2">Examination</a></h1>

    <!--TODO insert the notes for the examination section-->
   <h2>Site</h2>
   <p>Determine the anatomical location of the lump. Can be expressed as a well demarcated area such as left popletial fossa or describe with distances to fixed bony prominences. Keep in mind that body is three dimentional. Determine the depth as well. Depth can be expressed with the tissue plane such as subcutanneous. More informatin on the tissue plate is obtained after examining mobility</p>
   <h2>Size</h2>
   <p>An estimated for size is usually sufficient. Ask for any recent rapid enlargement in the history.</p>
   <h2>Shape</h2>
   <p>Not very helpful in diagnosis as almost all lumps will be spherical. Still it is added for completeness</p>
   <h2>Surface</h2>
   <p>Surface appearance can be smooth/rough, flat/raised, regular/irregular. Look for ulceration and necrosis.Color of the lump can be red if inflammed, black if necrosed.</p>
   <h2>Contour</h2>
   <p>Can be regualr or irregular</p>
   <h2>Consistancy</h2>
   <p>Describe as hard, firm, or soft.</p>
   <h2>Pulsatility</h2>
   <p>Pulsations can be transmitted or be intinsic pulsations. To diferentiate look for expansile pulsation.</p>
   <h2>Reducibility</h2>
   <p>Important when assessing hernial lumps. Compressiblity should be looked for in vericose veins</p>
   <h2>Fluctuation</h2><p>Fluctuation indicates the presence of fluid in the lump. Fluid thrill can be elicited for larger lumps</p>
   <h2>Mobility</h2><p>Very important to tell the tissue plane, attachments and the differential diagnosis. Lesions superficial to a muscle shoul be tested with the muscle relaxed and then contracted. If a lump that is mobile is fixed when muscle is contracted, the lump is attached to the muscle. Tethering can be demonstrated by moving the lump in two perpendicular planes as done for ganglions</p>
   <h2>Tendeness</h2><p>Ask for tenderness before palpation</p>
   <h2>Temperature</h2><p>To look for inflammation</p>
   <h2>Transilluination</h2><p>Cysts will transilluinate. Lipomas and even hydrocehalus may be transilluminant in sufficiently bright light</p>
   <h2>Percussion</h2><p>Limited use in small lumps. Hyperresonant abdominal masses indicate gas filled swellings</p>
   <h2>Auscultation</h2><p>to look for vascular lesions.</p>

<!-- Third section Summary -->
<div class="content">
    <h1><a name="section3">Present the findings</a></h1>

    <!--TODO insert the notes for the summary section-->
    <p>
	When presenting the examination findings, tell the size, position, attachments, consistancy, edges, surface (and shape), pulsations (and thrils, bruits), signs of infalmmation (redness, warmth and tenderness), and transillumination. 
	</p>
   <p>Comment on the regional lymph nodes when it is likely to be a malignant lesion or inflammatory lesion. Metastasis in to lymph nodes will cause firm or hard painless lymphnodes. Inflammation causes reactive lymphadenopathy with soft tender lymph nodes.</p>
